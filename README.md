# myCompliancePal
Let me introduce the project that I will present during the defense of the application designer & developer professional title. CDA in french

This application is named myCompliancePal and his main objective, is main purpose is to create a repository of compliance referents at the level of a large company like BG.

Compliance takes a more and more important role in the banking environment. new anti-corruption and new anti-money laundering laws has emerged. Also transparency requirements have been reinforced “la loi Sapin 2” in France(2016), UK bribery and corruption Act in United KingDom(2010).

This application could be a reference at the company scale and be used as a centralized source “a golden source” for collaborators or other internal company applications to determinate the compliance referent of any collaborator according the scope chosen.

My Compliance Pal will be dotted with a User Interface with security, authentication and different user permission that granted authenticated users, to make only permitted action according to their role in the application.

For instance some users will be able to just make queries and in other side, some other users with higher privileges will be able to insert, update, remove and oversee datas.
